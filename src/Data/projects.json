        "description": "Datopia is a data-based dating service. By analyzing data, it captures everything from the preferences you didn't know you had to your minor daily habits. Through this, it goes beyond simple encounters to find you a destined partner with whom you can maintain a continuous relationship. But can love really be determined solely by data? Can we entrust the reins of love to an algorithm? Datopia is a product of critical design that reflects on the changes that data-driven services, deeply integrated into our lives, can bring about in the way we form relationships with people. Imagine the future of love through Datopia.",
